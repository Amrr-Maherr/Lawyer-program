- **Database:** *(Note: Database details not available from the frontend. If you have access to backend, please specify it here. E.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc)*.

## Project Architecture

The Law Office Management System is built using a client-server architecture. The application consists of the following main components:

1.  **Frontend (Client-Side):**
    -   **Technology:** React.js
    -   **Responsibility:** This is the part of the application that users directly interact with. It is responsible for:
        -   Rendering the user interface components.
        -   Handling user interactions and events.
        -   Managing application state and routing.
        -   Making API calls to fetch and send data.
        -   Ensuring a responsive design across devices.
    -   **Key Components:** Includes components for user authentication, dashboards, client management, case management, appointment management, etc.
    -   **Communication:** Communicates with the backend using HTTP requests via axios.

2.  **Backend (Server-Side):**
    -   **Technology:** *(Note: This is not clear from the frontend. If you know the backend technology, update it here. E.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, PHP with Laravel, etc)*
    -   **Responsibility:** This part of the application manages the business logic and data storage. It is responsible for:
        -   Handling API requests from the frontend.
        -   Authenticating users.
        -   Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
        -   Enforcing business rules.
        -   Returning data in JSON format to the frontend.
    -   **Communication:** Receives requests from the frontend and sends responses back in JSON format.

3. **Database:**
   - **Technology**: *(Note: Database technology is not available from the frontend. If you know the backend technology, update it here. E.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc)*.
   - **Responsibility:** Persistent storage for the application's data. Stores data such as user information, client data, case details, appointments, and more.

4.  **API (Application Programming Interface):**
    -   **Technology:** Implemented using backend server-side technology.
    -   **Responsibility:** Acts as an intermediary layer that enables communication between the frontend and backend. It defines the endpoints that the frontend uses to interact with the backend, providing a structured and secure way to exchange data.

**Data Flow:**

1.  User interacts with the frontend.
2.  Frontend makes an API request to the backend.
3.  Backend processes the request and interacts with the database if necessary.
4.  Backend sends a JSON response back to the frontend.
5.  Frontend updates the user interface based on the response.

## Future Enhancements

- **Document Management System:** Implementation of a document management module.
- **Reporting Module:** Ability to generate reports related to clients, cases, and appointments.
- **Enhanced User Role Management:** Introduction of different user roles with varying access levels.
- **Multilingual Support:** Addition of support for more languages beyond Arabic.
- **Customizable Dashboard Widgets:** Allow users to customize what they see on their dashboard.
